 * every block. The `n % k` remainder trials are drawn from a cycle that carries over between
 * blocks and is only reshuffled once exhausted, so the leftovers do not always fall on the
 * same conditions and the run stays balanced overall as well. Shuffling happens per block, so
 * a condition never leaks into a neighbouring block.
 *
 * The result has exactly `plan.length` entries, so it is index aligned with the trial plan.
